A1. 
I only have a bit of Python programming experience. I knew that C is a relatively low-level language that runs very fast. However, I think it might also be challenging for beginners to master.

A2.
There are three major steps. At first, the original C text file will be loaded by the compiler, and then it will be converted into an object file with the“.o” or “.obj” suffix, which contains machine-level commands and is of course machine-readable. Finally, the linker will generate the final executable file based on the object file, in which the code is presented in binary form.

A3.
I am really interested in programming and have always been a self-motivated student. So, I would like to gain solid basic knowledge about C in the course as well as become more confident in learning.
