1. 
We call them "Parallel Arrays".  In parallel arrays, the elements with the same index contain information referring 
to the same object (entity), making it easy to manage and process.

In WS02, we declared the three parallel arrays (cost[], priority[], and financeOpt[]) to represent three different 
properties of items; more specifically, each index in the arrays corresponds to different properties of the same 
item.  After receiving the user's input of item information, we need to print a summary table containing the item 
number and three item properties. 

In that way, we can simply get the correct output by using a for loop since the item ID and its properties correspond 
with the same index (See the table below).

Item Priority Financed Cost
---- -------- -------- -----------
1 		1	 n 	39030.15
2		3	 y 1200000.00
3 		2 	 n   350500.25
4 		1 	 y     15500.75
5 		3	 n 	  6575.55
---- -------- -------- -----------


2. 
For Loop is the most convenient one with Arrays.

Example: 
	totalCost = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < itemsNum; ++i)
	{
		totalCost += cost[i];
		printf("%3d  %5d    %5c    %11.2lf\n", i + 1, priority[i], financeOpt[i], cost[i]);
	}

Rewrite the loop with While:
	totalCost = 0, i = 0;
	while (i < itemsNum)
	{
		totalCost += cost[i];
		printf("%3d  %5d    %5c    %11.2lf\n", i + 1, priority[i], financeOpt[i], cost[i]);
		++i;
	}

If we use While instead of For, we need to do two more things:
	1) Initialize the iterator outside before the loop.
	2) Manually modify the iterator after each iteration.

Thus, using For Loop for Arrays is more convenient.


3. 
As VS Studio is an IDE, once we have syntactic errors, VS Studio will prompt those errors with red wavy underlines
at each error place as well as error descriptions in the Error List. In this case, we are able to locate and correct all 
syntactic errors conveniently.

Semantic errors:
Those errors can be fixed in four steps:
	1) Run the code, input values, and check whether we get the correct results. If some of the output is incorrect,
	     locate the code section that probably causes the error based on the output.
	2) Set necessary break points in that section on the very left side in the VS Studio interface, running the debug
	     window, monitoring and checking the variables, input values, and output values step by step until the exact 
	     problem is found
	3) Correct the error and repeat the test process until the code runs as expected.
